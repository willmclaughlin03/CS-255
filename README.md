Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass client was a client in the business of DMV test prep. They sought for me to design a system that would allow them to test customers online based upon DMV standards, and allow client to make appointments for in person road tests with their employees.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe that my UML use case diagram was very good, and was descriptive in the use cases that every actor that was participating in the site would or could take. I also thought the relathionships I included in the use cases of the diagram were good as well.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my Gannt Chart. After analyzing others Gannt charts, I realized mine was messy and unorganized. I revised it before my project submission, but this was the main thing I was unsatisfied with at the beginning.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The biggest thing I interpreted from the user's needs was their need for security, and I implemented this into the system design in two ways. Firstly, I recommended that the DriverPass client use cloud software to host to maximize their database security and authentication. Secondly I provided thorough authentication features when logging in, and a good password reset system that continously allowed for users to reset passowrds if needed.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approached designing software as a process that needs constant refining. Everytime I though of something or created a process I would try to think if it could be made in a better way or a more secure way. I think I will include this strategy in the future, as it allowed forme to create the best processes and edits to those processes that I could. Taking time to think on the process of how you decide a process for software can be key in the deliverance of quality work.
